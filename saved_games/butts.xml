Why was he taking the life energy away from the people here? The Empire only needs power from the

tricks on people sometimes though.

Sprite: Come on old timer! Give me a break. Take it easy!.

Your memory might return if you receive some power from the Mana Seed.

Sprite: What? Really? I'll go now, right now!!!.

Princess: it won't make it if we leave it here. It's way too big for us to
     carry! Let's ask Truffle.

(Back in Throne Room)

Truffle: He'll only slow you down, so I'll raise him!

Nobleman: King Truffle!

Truffle: QUIET, you! You three get going. I'll take good care of him! By the
      way, how do you like the name "Flammie?"

 ( Ugh! Not bad! )

Truffle: Hang on! I sound like an idiot! You'd agree with me whether you
liked the name or not! So let's call him "Flammie" and be done with
it! Cannon Travel is open again in the forest to the south. You'll
find the Fire Palace somewhere in the Desert of Kakkara.

Thanatos: For ages I have been searching, for a human with the power to
conquer this world, one born in the shadow of darkness, and raised in the
light of Mana. Dyluck is the one. I cannot wait any longer. My body has grown
weak! It is time! Using his body I will take the Mana Fortress, and rule the
world!

Princess: Dyluck! Resist him with all your might!

Thanatos: Uhrg, ahh, kack! I must, hurry, This body is, breaking up!
H, help me, guhuf,let, m maieee!

Princess: Dyluck! Snap out of it!

Dyluck: Uhhn, Where am I? Guwa ha ha!

Thanatos:  Guwa ha ha! How good this new body feels! I grow strong!

Princess: Liar! You can't just STEAL someone's body!!

Thanatos: My dear, I can do anything I want! Ha, ha-huh? Can't, move!
Princess, can you hear me? It's me, Dyluck, He's too strong, I'm finished,
but I can help you,  Thanatos is an ancient sorcerer who sold his heart to the
underworld.

Though his life force is eternal, he hasn't his own body. His life
force is growing darker, He feeds on hatred and destruction!

Thanatos: Ooh! Silence!

Dyluck: Princess: I'm so sorry I won't see you again, But I have to do this.

Dyluck: You're Hero, right? Take care of Princess.

Princess: Dyluck! Stop it! Please! Dyluck! STOP IT!!

Thanatos: Ugrrrrrrr!

(Thanatos changes into Dark Lich)

Thanatos: I forbid this! Just when I was to be reborn! I must withdraw! Give
me your bodies! GUWAA!

Dyluck!!!

Hero: What the?! Let's get out of here!

Sprite: Uwaa!

Hero: What is is?

Sprite: whew! I'm okay just dizzy! We have to get out of here, NOW!

(Outside)

Sprite: It's a Mana Beast!

Sprite: Hurry, or the Mana Beast will ruin the world! Come on! Do it!

Hero: I can't, I won't hurt a Mana Beast! I can't! They are only trying to
restore Mana! And, Sprite! If you use up all your Mana power, you'll
disappear!

Princess: Oh NO!

Hero: Right, I can't go through with this.

Sprite: Whaddaya mean? I'm NOT gonna kick the bucket! My world is
seperate from this one. It just means I won't, see you again. ok, if we don't
stop the Mana Beast, your world is finished, right? Everything will perish.
Trees,animals, PEOPLE! That must not happen! YOU have the Mana Sword, YOU
must save this world, YOU have no choice! You made a vow to your mother, the
Mana Tree, right? I'll be okay.

Hero: All right, you're sure?

Sprite: OF COURSE! Later, Princess!
