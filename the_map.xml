    <intro>
        <text>Using the power of Mana a civilization had grown strong.
In time, Mana was used to create the ultimate weapon: the Mana Fortress.
This angered the gods, they sent their beasts to destroy the Fortress.
A violent war rocked the world, and Mana seemed to disappear.
Before all was lost, a hero with the Mana Sword smashed the Fortress.
Though the civilization had been destroyed, the world was peaceful again.
But time flows like a river, and history repeats.

Hero: Hey! Guys! Wait up!.

Elliot: Shh! Be quiet! The Elder will find us here and he'll be mad!.

Timothy: Yeah, We're not supposed to be here, There's a ghost around!.

Elliot: Ha! Do you really believe that? People say that to scare us! But I
heard Grandma say something about a shiny object near the falls.

Timothy: That must be some kind of treasure! We have to find it!.

(Hero starts to fall backwards)

Hero: Help! I'm falling! Aaahhhhhhhhhh!.

(After landing in a shallow pool)

Hero: Ouch! Phew! No way to get back up! Now what am I going to do?.

Hero: The village is this way, I have to find something to cut through!.

Mysterious Voice: Hero, Remove the sword.

Hero: Who are you, and what's this sword doing here?.

Hero: Urrrrrrrgh! Huh!? Ow! That light, so bright I can't see.

Mysterious Voice: Hero, It is I who asked, the sword.

Hero: !? Say what? You mean this sword?

*The brilliant light is gone in an instant*.

Elliot: I thought you were a goner.

Timothy: I told you it was stupid to bring someone like HIM along.

Elder: You idiots! Weren't you told not to go there? Huh? Hero! What's
that you have? Oh, no! It couldn't be.

Elliot: Cool! Did you find the treasure?

Timothy: Way to go!

Elder: What have you done?! How could YOU have pulled out the Mana Sword?
It's impossible.

Timothy: THE Mana Sword?! Legend has it that our village is finished.

Elder: If the sword is removed, And here it is! It is said that the Mana
Sword has been  protecting our village from disaster.

Elliot: So that's it! That's why all the monsters are attacking us now! How
could an outsider like you yank out the sword and bring doom to us all!!.
(Elliot hits Hero)

Hero: Hey! Stop it!.

Elliot: YOU did it!.

Elliot: It's all your fault!.

Elliot: You!.

Hero: Please, stop!.

Waaah!  Earthquake!

Villager: Elder! We can't go on like this.

Villager: Yeah! There's no end in sight.

Elder: Oh, Hero! You've really done it to me this time! The reason why
monsters have appeared is because you removed the sword.

Villager: It's settled, We can't let Hero stay in the village anymore.

Villager: If we do, more monsters will come after him.

Villagers: Go! Get out of here! Yeah, on your way now.

Elder: I don't want to do this, but I have no choice, I'm going to have to
ask you to leave the village, You can take what's in the treasure
chest downstairs.

Elder: I took you in and I raised you, But there's nothing I can do to help,
Please forgive me, I know I've told you this before, but Your
mother brought you to this village when you were just a baby, Soon
afterwards, she disappeared, I took you and have done my best to
raise you, But now we must part, I truly hope you can find your mother
someday, Good bye, Hero.

Elder: I took you in and I raised you, But there's nothing I can do to help,
Please forgive me.

Jema: Luka, monsters are invading villages. He just fought one!

Luka: I know. The ebb and flow of water brings me news from around the world,
Mana's power is growing weak, That's why this boy was able to take the
sword, When he did, the balance of Mana in this area shifted, and
monsters revived, There are evil monsters working to steal away the power
of the Mana Sword, By defeating those evil monsters, you can restore the
Sword's Mana power, The power is kept in orbs, Looks like it regained
some power from the Mantis Ant, There must be more hidden orbs which hold
Mana power for the Sword, And you must find someone who can forge the
sword to release its stored power.

Jema: Once I was one of Luka's followers. I studied the power of Mana, which
sustains everything in this world.

Luka: Jema, watch out for the Empire, It seeks to Obtain the Mana Fortress.

Hero: You mean the one that destroys the world in that fairy tale?

Jema: That's no fairy tale, The Empire is trying to awaken it.

Luka: The Empire is trying to unlock the seals from the world's Mana Seeds, A
bunch of strangers have already started snooping around this palace!

Jema: Something is very wrong in Pandora, Could the Empire be involved?

Luka: I don't know, Jema, see the king of Pandora and tell him to be
cautious.

Jema: Right, I'm on my way, Hero, you go to the cave called Gaia's Navel, Legend has it a
Mana seed is kept in its depths.</town_text>

Jema: Oh, Hero! Sorry, I was spacing out! Thanatos was one of their best men,
They must be desperate to get Mana.

Why was he taking the life energy away from the people here? The Empire only needs power from the
seeds, not from the people, There's something, curious about
Thanatos,  I've got a bad feeling about him. Anyway, let's get out of

tricks on people sometimes though.

Sprite: Come on old timer! Give me a break. Take it easy!.

Elder: Tropicalla broke out of a sealed palace. there must be a way into it!.
Your memory might return if you receive some power from the Mana Seed.

Sprite: What? Really? I'll go now, right now!!!.

Elder: Not alone! The palace was buried. There must be tons of monsters by
now, Would you be so kind as to accompany this sprite to the palace?
What luck! Dod you hear that, little one?.

Truffle: Here at last! The legendary knight!

Hero: ?

Truffle: You don't think we have legends here like everywhere else?!

                  Riding a white dragon, and
                   wielding The Sword, they
                    shall save the world.

Truffle: That's you guys, right? I knew it right away! Just yesterday one of
my people saw a white dragon fighting a huge snake! Go save it!

        <town_text> THIS is the legendary white dragon? Its parents must have been beaten by that
serpent.

Princess: it won't make it if we leave it here. It's way too big for us to
     carry! Let's ask Truffle.

(Back in Throne Room)

Truffle: He'll only slow you down, so I'll raise him!

Nobleman: King Truffle!

Truffle: QUIET, you! You three get going. I'll take good care of him! By the
      way, how do you like the name "Flammie?"

 ( Ugh! Not bad! )

Truffle: Hang on! I sound like an idiot! You'd agree with me whether you
liked the name or not! So let's call him "Flammie" and be done with
it! Cannon Travel is open again in the forest to the south. You'll
find the Fire Palace somewhere in the Desert of Kakkara.

Thanatos: For ages I have been searching, for a human with the power to
conquer this world, one born in the shadow of darkness, and raised in the
light of Mana. Dyluck is the one. I cannot wait any longer. My body has grown
weak! It is time! Using his body I will take the Mana Fortress, and rule the
world!

Princess: Dyluck! Resist him with all your might!

Thanatos: Uhrg, ahh, kack! I must, hurry, This body is, breaking up!
H, help me, guhuf,let, m maieee!

Princess: Dyluck! Snap out of it!

Dyluck: Uhhn, Where am I? Guwa ha ha!

Thanatos:  Guwa ha ha! How good this new body feels! I grow strong!

Princess: Liar! You can't just STEAL someone's body!!

Thanatos: My dear, I can do anything I want! Ha, ha-huh? Can't, move!
Princess, can you hear me? It's me, Dyluck, He's too strong, I'm finished,
but I can help you,  Thanatos is an ancient sorcerer who sold his heart to the
underworld.

Though his life force is eternal, he hasn't his own body. His life
force is growing darker, He feeds on hatred and destruction!

Thanatos: Ooh! Silence!

Dyluck: Princess: I'm so sorry I won't see you again, But I have to do this.

Dyluck: You're Hero, right? Take care of Princess.

Princess: Dyluck! Stop it! Please! Dyluck! STOP IT!!

Thanatos: Ugrrrrrrr!

(Thanatos changes into Dark Lich)

Thanatos: I forbid this! Just when I was to be reborn! I must withdraw! Give
me your bodies! GUWAA!

Hero: What the?! Let's get out of here!

Sprite: Uwaa!

Hero: What is is?

Sprite: whew! I'm okay just dizzy! We have to get out of here, NOW!

(Outside)

Sprite: It's a Mana Beast!

Sprite: Hurry, or the Mana Beast will ruin the world! Come on! Do it!

Hero: I can't, I won't hurt a Mana Beast! I can't! They are only trying to
restore Mana! And, Sprite! If you use up all your Mana power, you'll
disappear!

Princess: Oh NO!

Hero: Right, I can't go through with this.

Sprite: Whaddaya mean? I'm NOT gonna kick the bucket! My world is
seperate from this one. It just means I won't, see you again. ok, if we don't
stop the Mana Beast, your world is finished, right? Everything will perish.
Trees,animals, PEOPLE! That must not happen! YOU have the Mana Sword, YOU
must save this world, YOU have no choice! You made a vow to your mother, the
Mana Tree, right? I'll be okay.

Hero: All right, you're sure?

Sprite: OF COURSE! Later, Princess!
